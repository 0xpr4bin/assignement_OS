Explanation of "Everything is a File" in the Context of Our my_cp Code

Overview:
In Linux, the principle that "everything is a file" allows us to handle various types of resources uniformly. This concept is evident in our cp command implementation, which can copy not only regular files but also directories and devices.
Key Points Related to Our Code:

    Unified Handling of Resources:
        In our cp code, we use standard file operations (like open, read, write, close) to handle both files and directories. This demonstrates how different types of resources can be manipulated using the same set of functions.

    File and Directory Operations:
        Regular Files: When copying a regular file, we open it using open(source, O_RDONLY) and read its contents with read(). This is a straightforward application of treating files as streams of data.
        Directories: When we encounter a directory, we use the opendir() function to open it, and readdir() to iterate through its contents. Each entry can be treated like a file, allowing us to copy all files within that directory recursively.

    Device Files:
        If our code were extended to handle device files (found in /dev), we could use the same copy_file() function to read from and write to these devices. This shows the flexibility of the "everything is a file" philosophy, as we could treat hardware devices just like regular files.
